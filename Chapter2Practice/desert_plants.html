                        <p>Botanical name: Agaveceae</p>
                        <p>The Agave species is known for its striking form and general tolerance to cold, heat, sun, drought, and poor or alkaline soils. Agaves are some of the most useful plants in the hot arid regions of the Southwest. Sizes of agaves vary from one to six feet in height. They have many interesting leaf styles and color variations. The pointed leaves of the Agave Americana are armed with thorns at the tips. This leaf formation allows them to capture tiny amounts of rain, which guides the moisture down to the roots.</p>
                        <p>These plants need water occasionally until established or when plants show stress by wilting or withering. You should prune them in September.</p>
