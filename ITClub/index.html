      <p>This is a temporary website for the MHS IT Club.</p>

      <p>
        Here at IT Club, we strive to teach students about programming
        and computers in any way we can.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since MHS does not offer the kind of IT classes we are interested in,
        we decided to start this club ourselves.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our goal is to teach programming in more depth, whether that’s
        C, Python, or even Rust. At the end of the day, we’re here to learn
        and have fun.
      </p>

      <p>
        Soon we will have a schedule posted so everyone knows what’s
        happening over the next 30 days.
      </p>
